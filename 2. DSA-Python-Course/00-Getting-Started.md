## 💡 Tips for Success

### ✅ DO
- Read the explanation first, then look at code
- Draw diagrams for complex problems
- Practice dry running with your own examples
- Understand WHY, not just HOW
- Review previous topics regularly

### ❌ AVOID
- Memorizing code without understanding
- Skipping the dry run examples
- Moving to next topic without mastering current one
- Ignoring time/space complexity analysis
- Copying code without typing it yourself

## 🎯 Goals

By the end of this course, you will:
- ✨ Understand core DSA patterns
- ✨ Solve LeetCode medium problems confidently
- ✨ Optimize code for time and space
- ✨ Think like a problem solver
- ✨ Be interview-ready
