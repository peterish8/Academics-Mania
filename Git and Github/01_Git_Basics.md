# 01 Git Basics

## 🧠 What is Git?

Git is a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes in source code, supports team collaboration, and maintains complete project history.

### Key Features
- **Popular**: Industry standard for version control
- **Free & Open Source**: Publicly available source code that anyone can view, modify, and distribute
- **Fast & Scalable**: Handles projects of any size efficiently
- **Distributed**: Every developer has a complete copy of the project history

### 💡 Real-World Example
Imagine building a website and adding features one at a time:
- Add user login → commit
- Add shopping cart → commit  
- Add payment system → commit
- Don't like payment feature? → revert to previous version

```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version
```

## 🔧 Open Source Explained

Open source software allows anyone to:
1. **View** the source code
2. **Modify** the code for their needs
3. **Distribute** their modifications
4. **Use freely** (within license terms)

## ⚙️ Why Use Git?

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Version History** | Track every change made to your code |
| **Collaboration** | Multiple developers can work on same project |
| **Backup** | Distributed nature means multiple copies exist |
| **Branching** | Work on features without affecting main code |
| **Rollback** | Easily return to previous working versions |
