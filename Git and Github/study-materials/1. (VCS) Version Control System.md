## 🎯 Git Basics

### 1. 🤔 What is Git? (tool or software)
🔹 Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code, supports team collaboration, and maintains history. 📈

🔹 Git is Popular, free and open source, fast and scalable ⚡

🔹 Open source refers to software whose source code is publicly available for anyone to:
1. 👀 View
2. ✏️ Modify
3. 📤 Distribute
4. 🆓 Use freely (within the terms of its license)

💡 Ex: if we want to create a website and add feature you can add feature one at a time and if you don't want some feature then you can revert it 🔄

### 2. 🐱 What is GitHub?
🔹 Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using git. 💾
🔹 You can use your GitHub link in resume to show your work. 📄✨

## ⚖️ Centralized VCS vs Distributed VCS

### 1. 🏢 Centralized VCS
A single central server stores the complete codebase. Developers connect to this server to commit and update code.

🔑 Key Characteristics
🔹 One main server controls the entire project history. 🖥️
🔹 Developers get only working copies, not full history. 📋
🔹 If the central server fails, version history becomes inaccessible. ❌

📝 Ex: Subversion (SVN), CVS (Concurrent Versions System), and Perforce

### 2. 🌐 Distributed VCS
Every developer has a full copy of the repository including history on their local machine.

🔑 Key Characteristics
🔹 All operations like commit, log, and diff run locally. 💻
🔹 Servers are used mainly for collaboration and sharing changes. 🤝
🔹 If the server fails, any developer can restore the repository. 🔄

📝 Ex: Git, Mercurial

## 🗝️ Key Concepts

| 📋 Concept | 📝 Description |
|:-----------|:---------------|
| 📦 Repository | Storage of project and its history |
| 📁 Working Directory | Folder where files are modified |
| 🎭 Staging Area | Pre-commit area to prepare changes |
| 📸 Commit | Snapshot (means a saved state of the project files at a particular moment in time) of staged changes |

## 🆕 How to Create a GitHub Account?
🌐 Visit GitHub website link and create an account: https://github.com/

## 💾 Installing Git
🔹 Download and install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com

✅ Verify installation: check if the git is installed or not on your local system
Cmd: git --version

⚙️ Basic configuration: configure your GitHub username and email on local machine
Cmd: git config --global user.name "Your Name"
Cmd: git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

👤 Check user details
Cmd: git config --list

## 🆕 Creating a New Project using Git
📌 There are 2 ways to create

### 🔄 Method 1 - by Cloning Repository from GitHub
Cmd: git clone <repo link>

Cmd: (only for linux/Mac)
ls : list all files
ls - a : list all files including hidden

## 🔄 Understanding Staging and Commit Workflow
📊 There are Three states in Git:

| 🏷️ State | 📝 Description |
|:---------|:---------------|
| 📁 Working Directory | Where you modify files |
| 🎭 Staging Area | Where you place files before commit |
| 📦 Repository | Where committed changes are stored |

## 📄 File States on Local Machine (VSCode):
🔍 Every file in a Git repository exists in one of these key states:

| 🏷️ Git State | 📝 Meaning | 🎨 Typical VS Code Indicator | ⚡ Command to move to next state |
|:-------------|:------------|:----------------------------|:---------------------------------|
| ❓ Untracked | Git does not know the file yet | U symbol in Source Control | `git add <file>` |
| 👁️ Tracked | Git is watching the file for changes | Happens after first commit | - |
| ✏️ Modified | File changed but not staged | M symbol | `git add <file>` |
| 🎭 Staged | Marked for next commit | A/M in staged area panel | `git commit -m "message"` |
| ✅ Committed | Saved to local Git history | No icon (clean state) | `git push` |

💡 Ex:

📝 Create file and stage it
echo "# My First Git Project" >> README.md
Cmd: git add README.md

(OR)

📂 To add all the files use cmd:
Cmd: git add .

💾 Commit changes
Cmd: git commit -m "Initial commit"

🚀 Push to GitHub
Cmd: git push -u origin main (main is the origin here if you have other branch that you need to add)

### 🏠 Method 2 - Create locally and link to GitHub
📁 Create a new folder/project

📂 To make new directory
Cmd: mkdir myproject

🧭 Then navigate to that directory
Cmd: cd myproject

1. 🎯 Initialize Git
Cmd: git init

2. 📝 Create file
Add file with file name: index.html

3. 🎭 Stage it
Cmd: git add README.md

4. 💾 Commit changes
Cmd: git commit -m "Initial commit"

5. 🐙 Create repository on GitHub
Add remote link - A remote is a connection between your local Git repository and a hosted repository on platforms such as:
Ex: GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket

The remote link is the actual address (HTTPS or SSH) that establishes this connection.
cmd: git remote add origin git@github.com:username/myproject.git

6. 🚀 Push to GitHub
cmd: git push -u origin main

## 🔄 Pushing and Pulling
📤 Push Local Code to GitHub
Cmd: git push

📥 Pull Latest Code from GitHub
Cmd: git pull

## 📜 Checking History
Cmd: git log
Cmd: git log --oneline

## 🛠️ Essential Commands

1. `git init` - 🎯 Initialize a new Git repository
2. `git status` - 👁️ View tracked/untracked changes
3. `git add <file>` - ➕ Add files to staging
4. `git add .` - 📂 Add all modified files
5. `git commit -m "message"` - 💾 Commit staged changes
6. `git log` - 📜 View commit history
