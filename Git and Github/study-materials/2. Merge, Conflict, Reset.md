### 1. 🤔 What is git merge?
🔀 git merge combines the changes from one branch into another. It integrates histories and preserves all commits.

🎯 Typical use case: merging a feature branch into the main branch.

📝 Common commands:
```
# Switch to the branch where changes should be merged
Cmd: git checkout main
# Merge another branch into the current branch
Cmd: git merge feature-branch
```
⚡ Git will attempt an automatic merge. If no conflicting changes exist, a merge commit is created (unless fast-forwarded).

### 2. ⚠️ When do merge conflicts occur?
💥 Conflicts appear only when two branches modify the same part of the same file, and Git cannot decide whose change is correct.

📋 For example:
🔹 Both branches edit the same line of code
🔹 One branch deletes a file while the other updates it

🛑 Git will stop the merge and mark the conflict.

### 3. 👀 How Git shows merge conflicts
📄 Inside the conflicted file you will see markers:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes in current branch
=======
Changes from the other branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch
```
📖 Meaning:
🔹 <<<<<<< HEAD → your version
🔹 ======= → separator between versions  
🔹 >>>>>>> branch-name → incoming version

### 4. 🛠️ How to resolve a merge conflict
📋 Steps:
1. 📂 Open the conflicted file(s)
2. 🎯 Manually choose which content to keep
   ○ 👤 Keep yours
   ○ 📥 Keep incoming
   ○ 🤝 Combine both logically
3. 🗑️ Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
4. ➕ Add the resolved file
   ```
   Cmd: git add filename
   ```
5. ✅ Complete the merge
   ```
   Cmd: git commit
   ```
6. ❌ If you want to cancel the merge:
   ```
   Cmd: git merge --abort
   ```

### 5. 📊 Checking conflict status
📋 List conflicted files:
```
Cmd: git status
```

### 6. 🔧 Tools for easier conflict resolution
🎨 Graphical tools help visualize differences:
```
Cmd: git mergetool
```
🛠️ Examples: VS Code, GitKraken, SourceTree

## 📊 Summary Table
| 🎯 Action | 💻 Command |
|:----------|:-----------|
| 🔀 Merge a branch | `git merge branch-name` |
| ❌ Abort merge | `git merge --abort` |
| 👀 View conflicts | `git status` |
| 🛠️ Resolve conflicts | Edit file → `git add` |
| ✅ Finish merge | `git commit` |

### 7. 🤔 What does HEAD~ mean?
📍 HEAD → Your current latest commit (where you are now)
⬅️ HEAD~ → The commit just before the latest commit (you can also write HEAD~1, same meaning)

📋 Examples:
🔹 HEAD~2 → 2 commits before the latest
🔹 HEAD~3 → 3 commits before the latest

## 🔄 Meaning of git reset HEAD~
⬅️ This command moves the HEAD pointer to the previous commit.

📈 So if your commit history is like:
```
A → B → C (HEAD)
```
⚡ When you do:
```
Cmd: git reset HEAD~
```
📉 It becomes:
```
A → B (HEAD)
```
🗑️ The commit C is removed from history (but what happens to its changes depends on the reset mode)

## 🎛️ Three types of Reset with Effects
| 💻 Command | 🗑️ Commit Removed? | 🎭 Changes in Staging Area? | 📁 Changes in Working Directory? |
|:-----------|:------------------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `git reset --soft HEAD~` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (still staged) | ✅ Yes (still in files) |
| `git reset --mixed HEAD~` (default) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~` | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No (deleted changes) |

## 🎯 Default form (mixed mode)
```
Cmd: git reset HEAD~
```
✅ Removes last commit
✅ Keeps your changes in working directory
❌ Unstages them

💡 Best when commit message wrong / want to modify commit again

## 📝 Example Use Case
❌ You created a wrong commit:
```
Cmd: git commit -m "bad message"
```
🔄 Undo commit but keep changes:
```
Cmd: git reset HEAD~
Cmd: git add .
Cmd: git commit -m "correct message"
```

## ⚠️ Danger of using --hard
```
Cmd: git reset --hard HEAD~
```
💀 This totally deletes last commit + its changes
🚫 Not recoverable easily if not pushed

## 🌐 What if it is already pushed to GitHub?
🚫 Then avoid using reset (it rewrites history)
✅ Instead use:
```
Cmd: git revert <commit-id>
```
🛡️ This creates a new commit that undoes the changes safely.

## 📋 Quick Summary
| 🎯 Situation | 💻 Best Command |
|:------------|:---------------|
| 📝 Fix commit message | `git reset --soft HEAD~` |
| 📁 Forgot to add some files (redo commit) | `git reset HEAD~` |
| 🗑️ Want to delete last commit completely | `git reset --hard HEAD~` |
| 🌐 Commit already pushed | `git revert` |
