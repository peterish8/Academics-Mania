## 🍒 Cherry pick
🎯 git cherry-pick is a Git command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch — without merging the whole branch.

💡 It's very useful when you want to pick a single change or a few commits and apply them elsewhere.

### 🧠 Basic Concept
🌟 Suppose you have:
🔹 feature branch (where a fix or update was made)
🔹 main branch (your production-ready branch)

🎯 If there's one useful commit in a feature that you want in main — you can cherry-pick that commit instead of merging everything.

📝 Command Syntax:
```
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

Ex:
git cherry-pick e727570a8dbab0212a1f45848e88ab226db3c35d
```

### 📋 Step-by-Step Example
1. 👀 View commit history:
   ```
   Cmd: git log --oneline
   ```
   📊 Output example:
   ```
   f4e12ab Added login validation
   a7d39b2 Fixed header alignment
   d1a8c43 Added contact form
   ```

2. 🔄 Switch to the branch where you want to apply the commit:
   ```
   Cmd: git checkout main
   ```

3. 🍒 Cherry-pick the commit you want:
   ```
   Cmd: git cherry-pick a7d39b2
   ```
   ✨ This takes the changes from commit a7d39b2 and applies them to the main branch.

### 🛠️ Common Options
| 💻 Command | 📝 Description |
|:-----------|:---------------|
| `git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2>` | 📦 Apply multiple commits |
| `git cherry-pick -n <commit>` | ⏸️ Apply the changes but don't commit yet |
| `git cherry-pick -x <commit>` | 📝 Add a note in the commit message showing the original commit reference |
| `git cherry-pick --abort` | ❌ Cancel an ongoing cherry-pick (e.g., after a conflict) |
| `git cherry-pick --continue` | ▶️ Continue after resolving conflicts |

### ⚔️ Handling Conflicts
💥 If there are conflicts:
1. 🛑 Git will pause and show you the conflicting files.
2. 🛠️ Fix conflicts manually in your editor.

⚡ Then run:
```
Cmd: git add .
Cmd: git cherry-pick --continue
```

### 🌐 In GitHub (UI Method) (Optional)
🎨 Although cherry-pick is a Git command-line feature, GitHub also supports it through the web UI (for pull requests and commits):

1. 📂 Open the commit page on GitHub.
2. 🖱️ Click the "⋯" (three dots) → "Cherry-pick" (available on some GitHub Enterprise or web UIs).
3. 🎯 Choose the branch to apply it to.
4. ✨ GitHub creates a new branch and PR for you.

### ✅ When to Use Cherry-pick
🔹 To apply a specific bug fix from one branch to another.
🔹 To copy one commit to another release branch.
🔹 To avoid merging unwanted commits.

### ❌ When NOT to Use Cherry-pick
🔹 When you want to bring many commits or maintain history continuity → use merge or rebase instead.
🔹 Overusing cherry-pick can cause duplicate commits if not tracked carefully.

## 🌳 Branching Strategies
📋 Branching strategies define how developers collaborate, organize work, manage releases, and maintain code stability in Git repositories.

🎯 Different teams choose different strategies based on project size, release cycles, and collaboration methods.

### 🌊 Git Flow
🎯 Best for: Large products, scheduled releases
🌟 Uses multiple long-lived branches:

| 🌿 Branch | 🎯 Purpose |
|:----------|:-----------|
| `main` | 🚀 Production-ready code |
| `develop` | 🔧 Code for the next release |
| `feature/*` | ✨ New feature development |
| `release/*` | 🎁 Pre-release stabilization, versioning |
| `hotfix/*` | 🚨 Emergency fixes in production |

📋 Workflow:
1. 🌱 Create feature branches from develop
2. 🔄 Merge back to develop
3. 🎁 Create release branch → test → merge to main + develop
4. 🚨 For urgent bugs: hotfix from main → merge both back

✅ Pros: Good for big teams, structured
❌ Cons: Complex for small projects

### 🐙 GitHub Flow
🎯 Best for: Small teams, Continuous Deployment (CD), Web apps
🌟 Only one long-lived branch → main

| 🌿 Branch | 🎯 Purpose |
|:----------|:-----------|
| `main` | 🚀 Always deployable |
| `feature/*` | ⚡ Short-lived feature branches |

📋 Workflow:
1. 🌱 Create branch → work → open Pull Request
2. 👀 Review + CI checks
3. 🔄 Merge to main
4. 🚀 Deploy immediately

✅ Pros: Very simple, fast releases
❌ Cons: No dedicated release branch → risky if many developers push often
