# 🧬 Module 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## 📝 Overview
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm based on "objects" that contain data and methods. It helps structure software into reusable blueprints (classes) to safer, cleaner, and more modular code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define Classes and create Objects.
- Understand Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.
- Use Magic Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`).
- Design Abstract Base Classes.
