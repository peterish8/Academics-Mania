# 📂 Module 2: Core Python, Files, Errors, and Modules

## 📝 Overview
This module dives deeper into Python's core data structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets) and essential programming concepts like File Handling and Error Handling. These are crucial for building robust applications.

- Master Python's built-in data structures.
- Perform efficient data manipulation using List Comprehensions.
- Read from and write to key files.
- Handle errors gracefully using `try...except`.
- Organize code with Modules and install external packages.
