prevents chaos in large teams.

## 🛠️ 2. Common Strategies
### **Git Flow**
Specific branches for specific roles:
- `main`: Production-ready code.
- `develop`: Integration branch for features.
- `feature/*`: New features (merge into develop).
- `release/*`: Prep for new version.
- `hotfix/*`: Quick fix for production bugs.

### **GitHub Flow**
Simpler, used by many modern web teams.
1. `main` is always deployable.
2. Create branch from `main` for new work.
3. Open PR early for feedback.
4. Merge to `main`.
