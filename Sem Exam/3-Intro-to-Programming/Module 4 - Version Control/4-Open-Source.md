# 🔓 Open Source & Licenses

## 📌 1. Overview
Open source means the code is freely available for use, modification, and distribution.

## 📜 2. Licenses
You usually need a license to protect yourself and clarify usage rights.

- **MIT**: "Do whatever you want, just don't sue me." (Permissive)
- **Apache 2.0**: Like MIT but covers patent rights.
- **GPL (GNU Public License)**: Copyleft. If you use my code, your modified code must also be open source.

## 🤝 3. Ethics
- Be respectful in issues and comments.
- Give credit where due.
- Follow the project's `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
