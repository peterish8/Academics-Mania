# 🔗 Functions (Injective, Surjective, Bijective)

## 📌 1. Function Definition
A rule that maps **every** element in Domain $X$ to exactly **one** element in Codomain $Y$.
$f: X \rightarrow Y$

## 🎯 2. Types of Functions
### **Injective (One-to-One)**
Every $x$ maps to a **unique** $y$. No two inputs give the same output.
- *Test*: Horizontal Line Test (Graph intersects at most once).
- $f(a) = f(b) \implies a = b$

### **Surjective (Onto)**
Every $y$ in the Codomain is "hit" by at least one $x$. Range = Codomain.
- *Test*: Range equals Codomain.

### **Bijective (One-to-One Correspondence)**
Both Injective **AND** Surjective.
- **Invertible**: Only bijective functions have an inverse $f^{-1}$.
