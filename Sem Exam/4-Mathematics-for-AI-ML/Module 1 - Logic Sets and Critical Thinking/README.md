# 🧠 Module 1: Logic, Sets, and Critical Thinking

## 📝 Overview
This module builds the mathematical foundation for AI/ML. You will learn about formal logic, set theory, functions, and how to apply these concepts using Python.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master logical connectives and truth tables.
- Perform set operations and visualize them with Venn diagrams.
- Understand different types of functions (Injective, Surjective, Bijective).
- Use Jupyter Notebooks for mathematical computing.
