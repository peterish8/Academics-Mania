# 📉 Charts & Graphs

## 📌 1. Categorical Data (Qualitative)
- **Bar Chart**: 
  - Uses rectangular bars to compare categories.
  - **Key Feature**: Gaps between bars (unlike histograms).
  - *Use for*: Primary colors selected by students.
- **Pie Chart**: 
  - Circular chart divided into sectors/slices.
  - Shows percentage contribution to a total.
  - *Drawback*: Hard to compare angles; avoid if >5 categories.

## 📌 2. Numerical Data (Quantitative)
- **Histogram**: 
  - Shows frequency distribution of continuous data.
  - **Key Feature**: No gaps between bars; X-axis represents bins/intervals.
  - *Use for*: Height distribution of a class.
- **Frequency Polygon**: 
  - A line graph formed by joining the *midpoints* of the top of histogram bars.
  - useful for comparing multiple distributions on the same axes.
- **Stem & Leaf Plot**:
  - A hybrid of a table and a graph.
  - **Stem**: Leading digit(s). **Leaf**: Trailing digit.
  - *Example*: `2 | 3` represents 23.
  - Preserves the actual raw data values while showing the shape of distribution.
- **Ogive (Cumulative Frequency Curve)**: 
  - A smooth curve plotting cumulative frequency against upper class boundaries.
  - **Less-than Ogive**: Rising curve.
  - **More-than Ogive**: Falling curve.
  - *Key Use*: Locating Median, Quartiles, and Deciles graphically.

## 📌 3. Bivariate Data (Relationship)
- **Scatter Plot**: 
  - Plots pairs of values $(x, y)$.
  - Visually reveals correlation (Positive, Negative, No correlation).
- **Line Chart**: 
  - Connects data points with straight lines.
  - *Use for*: Time Series data (e.g., Stock prices over dates).
