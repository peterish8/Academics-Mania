# 🧮 AM, GM, HM & Properties

## 📌 1. Geometric Mean (GM)
The $n$-th root of the product of values. Used for growth rates, percentages.
$GM = \sqrt[n]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_n}$

## 📌 2. Harmonic Mean (HM)
Reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of reciprocals. Used for rates (speed).
$HM = \frac{n}{\sum (1/x)}$

## ⚖️ 3. Relationship
$AM \geq GM \geq HM$
(Equal only if all observations are identical).

$GM^2 = AM \times HM$ (For two numbers).

## 💡 4. When to allow which?
- **AM**: General purpose, additive data (Height, Weight).
- **GM**: Multiplicative data (Interest rates, Population growth).
- **HM**: Rate data (Speed: km/hr, Density).
