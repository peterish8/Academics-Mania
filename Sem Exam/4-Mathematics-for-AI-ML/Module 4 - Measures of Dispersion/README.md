# 📉 Module 4: Measures of Dispersion

## 📝 Overview
Central tendency tells us about the middle, but Dispersion tells us about the spread. How "scattered" is the data? This is crucial for understanding risk and variability.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Calculate Range, Mean Deviation, and Standard Deviation.
- Understand Variance and its relation to SD.
- Quantify asymmetry using Skewness.
- Measure peakness using Kurtosis.
