# 🎲 Classical, Empirical & Axiomatic Probability

## 📌 1. Classical (Theoretical) Probability
Based on equally likely outcomes.
$P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}}$
- Example: Tossing a fair coin. $P(Head) = 1/2$.

## 📌 2. Empirical (Relative Frequency) Probability
Based on actual experiments/data.
$P(E) = \frac{\text{Frequency of event occurrence}}{\text{Total number of trials}}$
- Example: Tossing a bent coin 100 times and getting 60 Heads. $P(Head) = 0.6$.

## 📌 3. Axiomatic Probability
Based on mathematical rules (Kolmogorov Axioms).
1. $0 \leq P(E) \leq 1$
2. $P(Sample Space) = 1$
3. For mutually exclusive events, $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
